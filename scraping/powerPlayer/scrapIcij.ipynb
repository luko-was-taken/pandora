The Brazilian company was a joint venture of the Andre Maggi Group and the Louis Dreyfus Commodities Group to “originate and trade soybeans and corn” from Brazil. The Maggi family has been ranked among the world’s biggest soy producers as well as one of the richest families in Brazil.\n",

Its purpose was to hold the intellectual property of the entire Amaya Group.   \n",
      "A year later, in May 2015, Appleby’s New Business Committee noted that Clark was an independent director of Amaya Inc., the sole shareholder of the Isle of Man company in which he had no controlling interest, according to the files.  When the committee recommended obtaining additional documentation on Clark, who was identified as a politically exposed person (PEP), the company complied “in order to proceed to assign the UK Amaya trademark to the new company so we can develop our portfolio,” PokerStars’s internal counsel wrote in an email. The beneficial owner of the Isle of Man subsidiary was to be Amaya’s CEO, David Baazov. \n",
      " Baazov resigned as CEO of the group months later, in August 2016, after the Quebec securities regulator charged him and other executives with insider trading, alleging that he had attempted to influence the price of Amaya’s securities during the acquisition of PokerStars in 2014.  Clark, who was identified in a New Jersey government report as a member of Amaya’s corporate governance committee overseeing confidentiality and trading policy as of December 2014, has not been accused of wrongdoing.  \n",

      "Kutesa created the Obuyonza Discretionary Trust in the Seychelles in 2012. The trust held shares in the Seychelles company Katonga Investments Ltd.  He created the trust, watched over its administration and was one of its beneficiaries. Kutesa’s daughter, Ishta, also is listed as a beneficial owner as well  as a future recipient of money from the trust. An internal Appleby document from 2015 reported that the company’s intended activities were “consultancy, investments, trading and airport services in Uganda.” The money for Katonga was to come from Enhas Uganda Ltd.,  another Kutesa entity, Appleby’s notes state. Kutesa has owned Enhas, a ground-handling service at Uganda’s Entebbe Airport, since the 1990s. In 1998, a Ugandan parliamentary committee named Kutesa and another co-owner in a report criticizing the privatization that helped create Enhas and led to its lucrative airport contract. The report concluded that the privatization had been “manipulated and taken advantage of by a few politically powerful people who sacrifice the people’s interests.” As part of a periodic review in 2015, Appleby labeled Kutesa’s companies a “high risk,” given his political role and media reports of alleged corruption and bribery involving Kutesa. Kutesa told Appleby that the purpose of the trust was to separate his government income “from his personal assets and belongings.” In 2015, however, Appleby noted that the companies connected to the trust  were dormant and that “it seems that nothing such is being done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kutesa confirmed to ICIJ’s media partner in Uganda, The Daily Monitor, that he established the companies, but “I have never done anything with it at all. I told Appleby to close it many years ago.” He said he had registered a company in Uganda and is paying taxes. \"I thought you could avoid, not evade, taxes but I found it was not practical, and unnecessary,” Kutesa told the Daily Monitor. “I don't have anything to hide.\"\n",

According to Serbian media reports, Ranin owns Serbian Nickel, a mining company that, in 2012, sought to invest about $1.4 billion in the country’s nickel deposits, causing protests in Serbia concerning the health risks of nickel “exploitation.” According to Malta registry files from 2012 and 2015, more than 90 percent of Ranin’s business interests were “outside Malta.” In October 2015, Djukanovic sold her half of Ranin shares to Serbian Nickel’s chief executive Radomir Vukcevic, who replaced her as company director. At present he remains the sole shareholder, according to Malta registry files.\n",

      "According to 2008 confidential emails, the lawyer representing Shawkat and his son, Ali, asked Appleby to hold in escrow about $140 million, the proceeds of the sale of the Shawkats’ shares in a joint venture with a Kuwaiti telecommunications company. The law firm refused that request but accepted them as clients later in 2008.\n",
      "Appleby set up the Passion Group Trust for the benefit of Mudhar Shawkat’s family members and registered three affiliated companies in the British Virgin Islands in 2008 and 2011, according to the files. Shawkat was identified in the Appleby documents as an “additional settlor” (a person who creates and funds a trust) of the Passion Group Trust and as a shareholder of Passion Investment Ltd., the trust’s investment arm.\n",
      "However, upon the incorporation of a not-for-profit entity, which was also a beneficiary of the trust, concerns about the Iraqi family’s reported association with Chalabi emerged at the law firm. “It is suspicious,” an Appleby employee wrote in an email, “that they are setting up a charitable company offshore [Passion for Change S.A.] for funds coming out of Iraq – there does not seem any benefit other than lack of accountability in doing so.” But Appleby continued to provide services  to Shawkat and his family after the firm’s managers  noted that, other than accusations of favoritism in the award of government contracts, there were no allegations against Shawkat. \n",
      "In the following months, in 2009, the leaked files show that the Shawkats transferred more than $30 million to the family trust and one of its affiliated companies, some of which was converted into shares. Board meeting minutes of Passion Investment Ltd. chaired by Shawkat’s son show that from 2013 to 2016, the company has invested in two medical companies and in an Iraqi dealership for Peugeot cars.\n",
      "The trust and its affiliates were still active as of February 2016, according to Appleby’s internal emails.\n",

      "Through a lawyer, Shawkat told ICIJ that he has no legal or beneficial interest in any of the four entities of the Passion Group, nor does he have control over or involvement in their business activities. He added that he has never had any commercial or business ventures or dealings with Chalabi.  In a response sent to ICIJ on November 15, Shawkat’s lawyer explained that, although Appleby initially declined to hold the sum specified – about $140 million – “it was in fact willing to accept those funds.” Its initial refusal had “nothing to do with either the identity of Dr. Shawkat, or the source of the funds,” he wrote. \n",
      "The lawyer also added that Shawkat was not an “additional settlor,” as indicated in Appleby records, because “he did not perform that function whether in fact or in law.” The Passion Group Trust was set up following his son’s instructions and Mudhar Shawkat's “only involvement was prior to the Trust being formed, and temporary,” the lawyer wrote. “For three weeks between 28 November and 18 December 2008 he held one share in Passion Investments Ltd., the Trustees holding 20,000 shares.” \n",

Information from the files indicate that it was originally operating under Bahamian law. Documents state that the trust owns Orchard Limited, an investment holding company listed as residing in the Bahamas. In 2002, Orchard held $124 million, according to financial statements. By April 2007, its holdings had nearly doubled to $236 million, and that year, Orchard distributed $8 million to beneficiaries, according to the records.\n",

Hugh Sassoon also told the Appleby representative that he was forwarding the tax memo to two Orchard Limited administrators and that “no doubt you will discuss it with them.”\n",

It held non-U.K. assets which were contributed only by his grandmother, who was not subject to U.K. taxes and who died more than 40 years ago. Because of the non-UK nature of the trust’s origin and assets, Sassoon said that there “is no question of assets having been 'moved offshore.'”\n",

Batu Mining Limited was the owner of Batu Mining Mongolia LLC, a company with a wide array of international investors that has held copper and gold exploration licenses in Mongolia. In December 2005, Batbold, then minister for trade and industry, transferred his shares in the BVI company to Ever Legend Engineering Limited, a company based in Hong Kong.\n",

      "A representative of Batbold told ICIJ that Batbold invested in Batu Mining Mongolia LCC when “its BVI-registered head company was not yet registered in Mongolia (i.e. it did not have legal presence in the Mongolian jurisdiction). Therefore, Mongolian investors had to invest in the Mongolian company…The BVI head company was only registered in Mongolia in February 2004 (although the BVI company’s incorporation began late 2003), whereas the Mongolian Company was incorporated in the 3rd quarter of 2003, i.e. a couple of months before the formation of the BVI head company. His shareholding in the Company was always transparent.” “The choice of a BVI parent vehicle was the pre-condition of the foreign investors to invest in Mongolia,” said the representative. “This was not, and is not, a breach of any Mongolian law.” “It was legal then, as it is now for public officials to invest and own shares, with no restrictions… Mr. Batbold's business was created in the early 1990's many years before entering any public office. Since then business was conducted according to our local laws and by hired professionals.” “The project in question, as with all other Government registered and permitted offshore-headed projects, brought capital into Mongolia to create jobs and revenue,” the representative said.Profile added on April 3, 2017\n",

In September 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice sought to enforce an Italian restraining order in U.S. courts that would constrain Nicosia from exercising any rights over his U.S. properties. But Amadocia sold the apartments in October for $3.72 million, before a court approved the Justice Department's request.\n",

An official investigation into possible influence peddling in the summer of 2014 resulted in no charges against Gutiérrez Robayo, according to the public prosecutor's office. Mossack Fonseca resigned from his companies because he was considered a \"politically exposed person.\" As a result, he hired another Panamanian law firm to keep his offshore network alive.

The law firm refused that request but accepted them as clients later in 2008.\\nAppleby set up the Passion Group Trust for the benefit of Mudhar Shawkat’s family members and registered three affiliated companies in the British Virgin Islands in 2008 and 2011, according to the files. Shawkat was identified in the Appleby documents as an “additional settlor” (a person who creates and funds a trust) of the Passion Group Trust and as a shareholder of Passion Investment Ltd., the trust’s investment arm.\\nHowever, upon the incorporation of a not-for-profit entity, which was also a beneficiary of the trust, concerns about the Iraqi family’s reported association with Chalabi emerged at the law firm. “It is suspicious,” an Appleby employee wrote in an email, “that they are setting up a charitable company offshore [Passion for Change S.A.] for funds coming out of Iraq – there does not seem any benefit other than lack of accountability in doing so.” But Appleby continued to provide services  to Shawkat and his family after the firm’s managers  noted that, other than accusations of favoritism in the award of government contracts, there were no allegations against Shawkat. \\nIn the following months, in 2009, the leaked files show that the Shawkats transferred more than $30 million to the family trust and one of its affiliated companies, some of which was converted into shares. Board meeting minutes of Passion Investment Ltd. chaired by Shawkat’s son show that from 2013 to 2016, the company has invested in two medical companies and in an Iraqi dealership for Peugeot cars.\\nThe trust and its affiliates were still active as of February 2016, according to Appleby’s internal emails.\\n',\n",

He added that he has never had any commercial or business ventures or dealings with Chalabi.  In a response sent to ICIJ on November 15, Shawkat’s lawyer explained that, although Appleby initially declined to hold the sum specified – about $140 million – “it was in fact willing to accept those funds.” Its initial refusal had “nothing to do with either the identity of Dr. Shawkat, or the source of the funds,” he wrote. \\nThe lawyer also added that Shawkat was not an “additional settlor,” as indicated in Appleby records, because “he did not perform that function whether in fact or in law.” The Passion Group Trust was set up following his son’s instructions and Mudhar Shawkat's “only involvement was prior to the Trust being formed, and temporary,” the lawyer wrote. “For three weeks between 28 November and 18 December 2008 he held one share in Passion Investments Ltd., the Trustees holding 20,000 shares.” \\n\",\n",

Three years later, in a database of high-risk clients, Appleby also noted that a Pakistani court had issued three arrest warrants against Aziz in relation to the killing of a local leader.

Asked why Aziz’s asset declarations in Pakistan didn’t mention the Antarctic Trust, the lawyer told ICIJ that the “legal owner” of the trust was Citicorp Trust Delaware N.A., not Aziz, and that Aziz and his family members paid all U.S. taxes they owed, the lawyer said. Cititrust is an affiliate of Citicorp where Aziz was an executive, and managed his personal assets for many years, the lawyer said.\\n',\n",

By April 2007, its holdings had nearly doubled to $236 million, and that year, Orchard distributed $8 million to beneficiaries, according to the records.\\nBy 2002, the trust had retained the global accounting firm Deloitte to advise it on tax matters. A 2008 fax from James Sassoon’s father, Hugh, to an Appleby administrator showed that Deloitte warned that U.K. taxpayers could be liable for U.K. taxes on more than $14 million of the trust’s funds in the case of a withdrawal.

It held non-U.K. assets which were contributed only by his grandmother, who was not subject to U.K. taxes and who died more than 40 years ago. Because of the non-UK nature of the trust’s origin and assets, Sassoon said that there “is no question of assets having been 'moved offshore.'”\\nThe creation of the settlement and its management company were disclosed to U.K. tax authorities and annual accounts have been sent to them as well, he said.\\n“Where U.K. domiciled individuals have received any benefit from the settlement, that has been disclosed in the normal way and any tax due has been paid. I have not received any benefit from the trust for more than 25 years,” said Sassoon. He also said that he disclosed his potential interest in the trust when he joined the Treasury in 2002, consistent with the Treasury’s disclosure rules.\\n\",\n",

The trust also owns property in southern England adjacent to Buckhurst Park, where Queen Noor resides and where she is responsible for keeping the premises “clean and tidy” and for “interior decoration.”\\nTo reduce inheritance taxes on the queen’s estate upon her death, the trustees in 2013 considered borrowing money and using Buckhurst Park as a security. This arrangement would lower the property’s market value and decrease inheritance taxes, according to internal notes. It is not clear whether the idea was implemented.\\nAccording to Appleby documents, the other trust, the Brown Discretionary Settlement, is the beneficial owner of a Jersey-incorporated  investment holding company with assets worth about $18.7 millIon in 2015.\\n',\n",

From at least 2004 to 2010, the duchy also invested in the Bermuda-based Jubilee Absolute Return Fund.\\nThe queen’s offshore investments have not been disclosed in annual financial reports of the duchy, which is not obliged to reveal the details of her personal wealth.

In October 2014, a Ukrainian bank in which Poroshenko owns a majority stake, International Invest Bank, wrote a reference letter to Mossack Fonseca saying that his accounts there “have been conducted properly up to our satisfaction.”\\n  ',\n",
       "  'texte': 'A spokesman for Poroshenko said that creation of the trust and related corporate structures had no relation to political and military events in Ukraine. Although Poroshenko didn\\'t include Prime Asset Partners in his financial disclosures, his financial advisers noted that neither Prime Asset Partners nor two related companies in Cyprus and the Netherlands hold assets. They said that the company was part of a corporate restructuring to help sell the Roshen group. The structure is in line with \"the market practice in Ukraine for businesses aiming to sell to strategic investors or to enter the capital markets, launch IPO, etc.,\" the advisers wrote. Although Poroshenko is the shareholder, his shares are managed by a licensed asset management company, and his assets have been held by an independently managed fund, Prime Asset Capital, since 2005, the advisers said. Those assets will be transferred to a \"blind trust\" once legal formalities are completed, according to the advisers.\\n    ',\n",

Under a complex proposal submitted to Mossack Fonseca in 2005, UF Universe Foundation would have ultimate control of AtaHolding, a major Azeri conglomerate. The 2005 proposal named President Aliyev's three children in addition to other senior members of Azerbaijan's tax office as beneficiaries. Two secretive companies central to this proposal were established through Mossack Fonseca although it is unclear whether or not the proposal was ever adopted. The UF Universe Foundation was inactivated in January 2007, but in January 2014, its representative asked Mossack Fonseca to reactivate it. In addition, Aliyev's daughters controlled a Panama-incorporated company and two others in the British Virgin Islands. The Panamanian company held a significant stake in a consortium of companies exploring goldfields in Azerbaijan. Aliyev's sister was the sole shareholder and owner of a BVI company registered in December 2005.

Batu Mining Limited was the owner of Batu Mining Mongolia LLC, a company with a wide array of international investors that has held copper and gold exploration licenses in Mongolia. In December 2005, Batbold, then minister for trade and industry, transferred his shares in the BVI company to Ever Legend Engineering Limited, a company based in Hong Kong.\\n  ',\n",
       "  'texte': \"A representative of Batbold told ICIJ that Batbold invested in Batu Mining Mongolia LCC when “its BVI-registered head company was not yet registered in Mongolia (i.e. it did not have legal presence in the Mongolian jurisdiction). Therefore, Mongolian investors had to invest in the Mongolian company…The BVI head company was only registered in Mongolia in February 2004 (although the BVI company’s incorporation began late 2003), whereas the Mongolian Company was incorporated in the 3rd quarter of 2003, i.e. a couple of months before the formation of the BVI head company. His shareholding in the Company was always transparent.” “The choice of a BVI parent vehicle was the pre-condition of the foreign investors to invest in Mongolia,” said the representative. “This was not, and is not, a breach of any Mongolian law.” “It was legal then, as it is now for public officials to invest and own shares, with no restrictions… Mr. Batbold's business was created in the early 1990's many years before entering any public office. Since then business was conducted according to our local laws and by hired professionals.” “The project in question, as with all other Government registered and permitted offshore-headed projects, brought capital into Mongolia to create jobs and revenue,” the representative said.Profile added on April 3, 2017\\n    \",\n",

       "  'text': \"In 2004, Deng Jiagui, the brother-in-law of China’s current President Xi Jinping, acquired a company in the British Virgin Islands called Supreme Victory Enterprises Ltd and was the sole director and shareholder. The company was struck off the BVI registry in 2007. In September 2009, Deng became the sole director and shareholder of two additional British Virgin Islands-based “shelf companies” in Mossack Fonseca's inventory. The companies were called Best Effect Enterprises Ltd and Wealth Ming International Limited. Mossack Fonseca helped Deng obtain a “chop” – a carved metal or stone seal often used by Chinese businesses to validate documents in lieu of signatures – for Best Effect Enterprises. It is unclear what the two companies were used for. At the time, Xi Jinping was one of nine men on the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee, the body that rules China. By the time Xi was named general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012 and the country’s president in 2013, Deng’s two BVI companies were dormant.\\n  \",\n",

The couple’s Swiss lawyer told Mossack Fonseca that Cofic’s source of funds was business profits from helping other clients of his law firm export heavy machinery from Europe to China. Mossack Fonseca appears not to have realized Li Xiaolin was the daughter of a former Chinese premier. To assist a background check by Mossack Fonseca, Li’s lawyer submitted a passport issued to her by the Hong Kong special administrative region and a cover letter in which he refers to her as “Xiaolin Liu-Li,” which may have made linking her to Li Peng more difficult.\\n  ',\n",

In March 2008, Sonnette Overseas and four other offshore-companies gained major influence over Kamaz , Russia's largest truckmaker, for almost a year. International Media Overseas owned Med Media Network, which in turn controlled 12.5% of Vi, Russia’s largest television advertising buyer, formerly known as Video International.

Makhlouf also held accounts at HSBC for Lorie Limited,  Dorling International Limited, and Ramak Ltd., named after Makhlouf's company in Syria, Ramak Contracting & Trading. HSBC handled Cara Corporation, where he was a director; Seadale International Corporation, which he owned with his brothers, Eagle Trading & Contracting Limited owned by Hafez and Hoxim Lane Management Corp. for another brother. Beginning in February 2011, employees at Mossack Fonseca discussed via email allegations of bribery and corruption made against members of the Makhlouf family and sanctions that had previously been imposed by the U.S. Treasury Department. In June the same year, the BVI Financial Services Commission wrote to Mossack Fonseca regarding an investigation under anti-money laundering laws into Drex Technologies S.A., prompting Mossack Fonseca to cut ties with the Makhlouf family's companies.\\n  \",\n",

Promotional literature noted the fund was “not liable to taxation on its income or capital gains” and that the fund \"will not be subject to United Kingdom corporation tax or income tax on its profits.\" Blairmore used a large amount of bearer shares –unregistered shares that belong to anyone who physically holds the share certificates– until 2006.\\n  ',\n",

In 2011, the year in which his father resigned the Egyptian presidency and was arrested along with Alaa and another son, BVI authorities told Mossack Fonseca to freeze Pan World\\'s assets, an order prompted by a European Union law. In 2013, Mossack Fonseca was fined $37,500 for failing to properly check into Alaa Mubarak, \"a high risk customer.\" Internally, Mossack Fonseca admitted its procedures were \"seriously flawed\" as Mubarak hadn\\'t been identified early enough. Credit Suisse, however, wrote Mossack Fonseca that Pan World\\'s activities – \"one investment with HIG Venture Fund\" and a cash account with the bank – did not contravene Switzerland\\'s freeze on Mubarak\\'s assets. In 2014, a second BVI agency started investigating Mossack Fonseca and Pan World. Company employees admitted internally that they could be found \"in further breaches.\" Noting they had \"very little control\" over Mubarak\\'s company, they resigned as its agent in April 2015.\\n  ',\n",

Later that year, it controlled a bank account in Panama worth $75,000. His mother - Theresa Kufuor, then-Ghana’s first lady - was also a beneficiary. In November 2010, an employee in Mossack Fonseca's compliance office in the British Virgin Islands suggested to colleagues that “due to the apparent prevalence of corruption surrounding Mr. Kufour we would not recommend us taking him on as a client or continuing business with him.” Mossack Fonseca, however, continued to do business with Kufuor. In 2012, Kufuor asked Mossack Fonseca to close the trust. Files also connected Kufuor with BVI companies Fordiant Ltd and Stamford International Investments Group Limited. Both were registered when Kufuor’s father was president of Ghana and became inactive in 2004 and 2007.\\n  \",\n",

The origin of the company's funds was listed as “personal savings.” From 2010 to the beginning of 2015, the company's ownership was through bearer shares, a financial instrument that can be used to hide an owner's identity. One of the directors, Sergio Tadisco told ICIJ partner Canal Trece that he was just a figurehead who said he agreed to his name being used in 2011 because of his friendship with Muñoz and his wife. In January 2015, Muñoz and his wife became named shareholders, owning 50 percent each. By that time, Mossack Fonseca had become the registered agent of Gold Black. However, only three weeks later, its compliance department proposed resigning because Muñoz was identified in connection with the governments of the Kirchners. The resignation became effective in June 2015.\\n  \",\n",

The firm originally had been registered in Panama in May 1969. As of March 1993, neither of them appeared, nor did they ever again, as directors. Since that year, the intermediary representing the undisclosed owner of the company was Madrid-based Gómez-Acebo & Pombo Abogados, a law firm founded by Pilar de Borbón's brother-in-law Ignacio Gómez-Acebo. Before that, London-based Timothy Lloyd had represented the company. In 1993, Lloyd indicated that Pilar de Borbón was the owner of Delantera Financiera SA. Pilar de Borbón's son Bruno Alejandro Gómez-Acebo Borbón became director and treasurer of the company from July 2006 until its dissolution in June 2014.\\n  \",\n",

Although the company was at first held through so-called bearer shares, which do not list an offshore company’s owner, emails confirm that the firm belonged to N’Da Ametchi. The company’s purpose was described as “management of personal assets…[and] ownership of a bank account in the Principality of Monaco.” In one 2011 email from N’Da Ametchi to Mossack Fonseca’s Geneva office, the business executive discussed selling assets and the transfer of nearly $5,000. Although N’Da Ametchi’s financial managers told Mossack Fonseca in 2014 that “the beneficial owner of the company does not wish to maintain his company and wish to terminate it,” the company was still active in 2015. There is no indication from emails whether Mossack Fonseca was aware of the European sanctions.\\n  ',\n",

That same year, she began a relationship with a mining company that U.S. authorities alleged had paid her $5.3 million to help it win a disputed mining concession from her husband, then-President Lansana Conté, shortly before he died in late 2008. Investigators said Matinda was a conduit for much of the money paid to Touré. Touré, who is cooperating with U.S. authorities as part of an ongoing probe, has admitted to receiving bribes in order to influence her husband. She used a stand-in shareholder, Beneficence Foundation, and a Swiss company as the foundation’s manager, which reduced public connections between Matinda and Touré. The company ceased to operate on 30 April 2010.\\n  ',\n",

She was then vice consul general of Ecuador in Miami. The $190,000 mortgage was to purchase a house in North Miami Beach. At the time, Delgado served as governor of the Central Bank of Ecuador. An agent of Austrobank emailed Mossack Fonseca to obtain legal advice . The first law firm contacted by Mossack Fonseca declined to process the loan, saying the borrower was refusing to agree to standard conditions in the mortgage documents. “There are just too many holes in this transaction”, wrote the lawyer. “I have concerns over the borrower’s objections here. Something just doesn’t smell right here in my opinion,” he added. But Mossack Fonseca found another lawyer who recorded the mortgage in Miami.

The story linked Almeyda to a corruption case and a company registered by Mossack Fonsecca. As a consequence, Mossack Fonseca resigned from representing the firm. According to Mossack Fonseca internal communications, Trei Investments Corp.was incorporated in Panama in 1999, but never paid its fees nor had any activity . The former head of Peru's intelligence agency was director and secretary of the firm from just after its creation, which dated back to when he worked as a lawyer. He appeared as the main contact for the business. In 2000 the company was sold, but Almeyda remained as a director. Though Mossack Fonseca resigned as the company's agent, the company showed up as active in the Public Registry of Panama in December 2015 with César Almeyda as one of its directors.\\n  \",\n",

The company was incorporated on September 13, 2001 in Niue and moved to Samoa in 2006. It was inactivated on Feb. 16, 2009. In both Niue and Samoa, the company was held by “bearer” shares, which belong to the individual who physically holds them, making it easier to obscure ownership. Medea Investments Limited (Samoa) was one of two companies to hold shares in the New York company Blue Nile Consulting LLC in October 2007.\\n  ',\n",

Documents appear to show that Cahuzac's ownership of the account was disclosed to Mossack Fonseca at the time French authorities were investigating allegations of tax fraud by Cahuzac in 2013. When Seychelles authorities questioned Mossack Fonseca about the account, the company asked for more information about Cerman Group from the firm that had originally asked to create it. That information revealed Cahuzac's involvement. Mossack Fonseca told Seychelles authorities in May 3, 2013, that they were discontinuing their business relationship with Cerman Group because of its connection to the French politician, who was a high risk “Politically Exposed Person”.

In June 2015, Mizzi established a trust in New Zealand that is the shareholder of Hearnville. The beneficiaries of this trust are his wife — Malta\\'s consul in Shanghai — and two children. In June 2015 Mizzi told Mossack Fonseca he would use Hearnville as a management consultancy and brokerage firm. On this last point, Mizzi said that he filled out a \"standard category wording that was included in a template form which was part of the company acquisition process.\"\\n  ',\n",

The company, which the law firm said has no assets nor bank accounts, was owned by a family trust under an arrangement recommended by professional advisers. The trust was registered in New Zealand, where the law firm noted trustees \"are obliged to declare relevant information to the New Zealand tax authorities, who in turn will share this information with the Maltese tax authorities. The firm also said Mizzi \"declared his interest in the Company and the Trust in his 2015 Ministerial Declaration of Assets at the first available opportunity.\" Mizzi has asked Malta\\'s tax authorities to audit his financial affairs and has said that he will close Hearnville once it is complete.\\n    ',\n",

Refill Trading used bearer shares, a financial instrument used to obscure the owners of companies. The Panama offshore company opened an account in Swiss private bank Pictet, listing Lyra as its sole authorized signatory. He did not disclose his control of Refill Trading or the Swiss bank account in his asset declarations of 2010 or in 2014 as a candidate for the lower House of the National Congress. Mossack Fonseca identified Lyra as a politically exposed person beginning in 2009 on but didn't ask him for additional information, according to the files.\\n  \",\n",

       "  'text': \"In 1999, Chiriboga, then a lawyer in private practice, was hired to collect a debt from a couple who owned a house in the exclusive residential area of La Viña. In November that year, Chiriboga created Madrigal Finance Corp. in Panama, and in December, in order to buy the house, the company granted him a power of attorney including “full authorization to set the price of the property.” Madrigal Finance purchased it for less than $2,800. The former owners later sued Chiriboga for fraud, as they estimated it was worth about $1 million. He finally prevailed, with the court ruling that the couple had not proven the property's actual value. From 2005, when he was appointed labor minister, to now as Ecuador’s attorney general, he has been inconsistent in disclosing his connection to the company when he declared his assets. Weeks before he took office as attorney general in July 2011, his wife María Victoria Espinal asked Mossack Fonseca to remove Chiriboga and other directors of Madrigal and to replace them with nominees supplied by the Panamanian law firm, although her husband remained the sole shareholder.\\n  \",\n",
       "  'texte': 'Chiriboga did not respond to repeated requests for comment. On April 13, in an interview with El Universo, Chirigoba said he is a stockholder  \"in a company that in turn holds a property.” Asked why he did not state that fact in his asset declarations between 2005 and 2008, he said, “I think I declared my shareholding when I became the general attorney in 2011.” \\n    ',\n",

In September 2014, four months after he left politics, he became director of Mayer & Collins Trading Company Ltd. Hungarian businessman Imre Kökényesi is co-director of both companies,  which manufacture and sell toys in China, Hong Kong and Hungary, and are registered with Mossack Fonseca in the Seychelles. Company Registration & Business Services Limited, which works with Mossack Fonseca, manages the companies out of Hong Kong, and is also shareholder of Excelle. It contacted Mossack Fonseca in 2013 about opening a bank account with HSBC for Excelle. In March 2015, after Horváth had been out of politics for 10 months, Mossack Fonseca identified him as a politically exposed person.\\n  \",\n",

In April 2014 Stardale Management\\'s board of directors tried to open an account with Eurobank Cyprus Ltd. A year later the company was dissolved.

       "  'text': \"In 1995, Pamela Sharples became the sole shareholder of Nunswell Investments Limited, a company based in the Bahamas that she used to make investments. By 2001, her son, David Richard Sharples, had joined her as shareholder and director of the company. The elder Sharples didn't deal with Mossack Fonseca directly; she managed her company through an employee of a British law firm who also was a director, along with an accountant from another firm. Sharples used her official Parliamentary email address to communicate with them. In late 2013, they discussed whether it made sense to defer a distribution from her Nunswell account, if she didn't need the funds, to postpone paying taxes on it. The documents don't indicate whether Sharples followed through with that idea.\\n  \",\n",
       "  'texte': 'The law firm handling Sharples\\' affairs said that she became a director of Nunswell in 2000 and that the company was registered in the United Kingdom in the same year and now pays taxes to the British government. The law firm wrote that the House of Lords \"has been notified of Baroness Sharples\\' oversight in registering her interest as a Director of Nunswell Investments Limited\" and that she receives \"no remuneration...nor any income or capital from that company.\" Her son is a director and is a shareholder of the company on behalf of a trust, \"not on a personal basis.\"\\n    ',\n",

The main purpose of the company was handling offshore savings accumulated by Villanueva, which were deposited in Swiss EFG Bank. Mossack Fonseca\\'s Luxembourg issued a power of attorney to Villanueva, giving him the right to authorize transactions. However, internal emails showed that the founders of the Panamanian law firm revoked his authority because of “a high risk on doing business with this person” as he had “direct access to the public treasury, and the origin of his funds” could be “questioned at any given moment,\" so the probabilities of a scandal” were “higher.” They referred to him as “a total PEP” or politically exposed person. However, one of the company\\'s partners, Chris Zollinger, favored continuing the business relationship with Villanueva. In January 2010, Mossack Fonseca skirted the PEP problem by granting power of attorney of Blue Sea to his daughter Anny Josefina Villanueva.\\n  ',\n",

They used Sierra Leona to invest in the mining and food distribution sectors in Chile; to receive their dividends from their investments; and to open bank accounts, including accounts at Terrabank in Miami, HSBC Bank in Panama, Bank American Express, Credit Suisse, Multibank and Banco General.

Ibori was also connected to Financial Advisory Group Ltd. and Hunglevest Corporation, although Mossack Fonseca’s files do not specify the exact nature of his connection. In 2008, Mossack Fonseca received a request from the Seychelles government to produce documents as part of a probe by the Crown Prosecution Service, England's principal prosecuting authority, of Ibori and alleged criminal activities. In 2012, Ibori pleaded guilty in a London court to laundering and fraud charges. During court hearings in the United Kingdom, prosecutors claimed that Ibori opened a Swiss bank account in the name of Stanhope Investments through which millions of dollars were later channeled to ultimately buy a $20 million private jet.\\n  \",\n",

The activities of these companies were not revealed. In 2005, Mossack Fonseca received court documents because it was the agent for Hearnville Estates Ltd., a British Virgin Islands-based company named as one of 20 defendants, including Shansonga himself, in a corruption case that the Zambian government pursued in an English court. The company, incorporated in 1998, was allegedly used to purchase apartments in Lusaka with money looted from the Zambian state.\\n  ',\n",
       "  'texte': 'Shansonga did not respond to repeated requests for comment prior to publication. Following publication, Shansonga communicated through a lawyer in Denmark. Shansonga said he was not in government until June 2000 and was therefore not required to declare interest in any business activity. Shansonga said he knows nothing about Hearnville Estate Limited. He also said matters involving him have been discontinued, that he never fled Zambia and that media reports are false. Shansonga was not accused of money laundering and the civil matter was appealed and settled, according to the statement conveyed by the lawyer.\\n    ',\n",

In 2008 and 2010, they restructured their assets and established two foundations in Panama of which they, and their son, were beneficiaries. Through The Nedstar Foundation, they owned Nedstar Commercial Ltd. and Newington Group Trading Ltd., both based in the BVI. Newington's activity was trading in iron ore. Through The Pruak Foundation, they owned Biscay Overseas Limited  — later renamed Biscay Exports Limited — and Krims Investments Inc., also based in the BVI. They signed a financing agreement with the bank BNP Paribas (Suisse) SA for Nedstar Commercial. In 2011, 2012, and 2013,  Mossack Fonseca received documents related to legal proceedings against Kejriwal's companies. The Nedstar Foundation and Nedstar Commercial were inactivated in 2011, Biscay in 2012, and both Krims and Pruak in 2013. Newington was struck off in October 2012.\\n  \",\n",
       "  'texte': 'Kejriwal said he set up entities in Panama and the British Virgin Islands because business partners \"had agreed to finance or support the exports of iron ore\" from India. He said he soon realized that having offshore companies could be a problem. When he learned he had to declare his income from the companies to the Indian government and had difficulty obtaining bank credit, he closed the offshore companies in 2010. The two foundations were closed shortly after they were set up, he said.\\n    ',\n",

Jasmine Li was also the sole shareholder of another BVI company called Xin Sheng Investments. Harvest Sun and Xin Sheng are the parent companies of two Beijing-registered consulting companies.

In October 2015, a report by Brazil\\'s attorney general connected De Oliveira to Brazil’s Lava Jato (\"Car Wash\") corruption scandal. In 2011, Brazil\\'s state-owned energy company Petrobras bought a 50 percent stake of an oil field in Benin controlled by de Oliveira’s companies. Twelve of his 14 offshore companies were incorporated just months before his agreement with Petrobras. According to the attorney general\\'s report, in May 2011, de Oliveira wired $10 million to a Swiss bank account held by João Augusto Rezende Henriques, a lobbyist for Brazilian party PMDB, through Acona International Investments Limited, a Seychelles company also registered by Mossack Fonseca in 2010. Over the next several weeks, the report said, Rezende Henriques wired $1.5 million to a Swiss bank account controlled by Eduardo Cunha, president of Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies and a member since 2003.\\n  ',\n",

The apartment was purchased in a transaction completed in 2003 for more than $500,000, according to U.K. records. Sapphire Holding used unnamed shareholders until 2015 when Kojo Annan became a listed shareholder with a Ghana address. Mossack Fonseca continued to communicate with Annan at the central London address, Argyll Mansions, into 2015. Kojo Annan was also a joint shareholder and director of two British Virgin Islands companies incorporated in 2002 .\\n  ',\n",

Darion Trading also signed the apartment purchase documents as sole shareholder and president of Amadocia Inc. In September 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice sought to enforce an Italian restraining order in U.S. courts that would constrain Nicosia from exercising any rights over his U.S. properties.

The pilot told local authorities that the aircraft was brought to Guatemala from Honduras on the owners\\' instruction because they still owed $2 million to the seller. Some days before, U.S prosecutors had indicted three of Rosenthal\\'s relatives on a charge of laundering money for drug trafficking organizations: father Jaime; brother Yani, a former government minister; and cousin Yankel, former minister of investments.

He was the owner of at least 11 of the companies and one foundation. However, he managed the whole network with his wife, who co-owned a company and was the main beneficiary of a foundation; and one of his associates, who was also a co-owner of three firms. The companies\\' activities took place in Panama, Colombia, United Kingdom and Switzerland in sectors including biotechnology, cattle ranching and real estate. An official investigation into possible influence peddling in the summer of 2014 resulted in no charges against Gutiérrez Robayo, according to the public prosecutor\\'s office. Mossack Fonseca resigned from his companies because he was considered a \"politically exposed person.\" As a result, he hired another Panamanian law firm to keep his offshore network alive. When their firms were with Mossack Fonseca, Gutiérrez Robayo and his wife opened a Swiss bank account between 2010 and 2011.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'text': 'In September 2000, Devillers helped Gu Kailai, the wife of a high-ranking Chinese Communist Party official, incorporate Russell Properties S.A. in the British Virgin Islands. Court records show that Devillers held shares in the company on behalf of Gu and that the offshore company was used to secretly purchase a villa in the south of France. The $3.2 million used to purchase the villa was a bribe from a Chinese businessman for whom Gu’s husband had helped secure several business deals. Gu testified at her husband’s corruption trial that she wanted to keep the property secret in order to avoid tax but also because owning a luxury overseas property could have threatened her husband’s career. Her husband, Bo Xilai, was a rising political star and had been expected to ascend to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee in 2013. But in November 2011, Gu poisoned and killed an English acquaintance, sparking an investigation that ended with both her and her husband imprisoned for life. Before the murder, Russell Properties had been held by proxies in the offshore jurisdiction of Jersey. After the murder, Devillers became the sole director and shareholder of the company.\\n  ',\n",

Molina Bonilla negotiated terms for starting up Mossack Fonseca & Co. (Quito) Ltd., incorporated in the Seychelles for the purpose of selling offshore companies to Ecuadorian clients. Molina Bonilla worked there until the end of 2011. Then he moved to Corporate Consulting Group Inc., another law firm that was registered in Anguilla by Mossack Fonseca in 2011 and inactivated in 2014. After he helped set up Mossack Fonseca Quito, Molina Bonilla was owner, shareholder and/or officer of nearly 20 companies operating in five different offshore jurisdictions. Some remained active as of the end of 2015. During the period Molina Bonilla was involved with offshore companies, he was the director in 2007 of the state-owned company Avindac, which provided airport services, and from 2014 to 2015, adviser to the National Intelligence Secretariat, an agency under the direct supervision of Ecuador’s president.\\n  ',\n",

He added that he was a temporary adviser to the National Intelligence Secretariat, not a member of its permanent staff. \"I just sent a monthly invoice, and I don\\'t work for them anymore, as I am an independent lawyer,\" he said.\\n    ',\n",
